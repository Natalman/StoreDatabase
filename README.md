# StoreDatabase
        ProjectDesc:
What I am doing is creating a store management database type that allows the Manager and employee to best manage their
costomer and the store. I first made table of rep with customers, items and order. the purpose of the app is to keep track of
customer acticities such what the buy, their balance, and their reps. It also keeps track of orders, how many item they have 
in the store. Whenever a customer places and order, it will then updates the customer balance, the on hand item, and 
commission if the customer gives one.
        Bugs:
I am still working on the user validation
Everytime I reRun the app i have to go back an drop or delete the oldest tables.
There are duplicate code that I will fix.
